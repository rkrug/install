## What this package will do
- save installed packages to `installed_packages.txt` file
- read `installed_packages.txt`
- reinstall packages in character vector or based on read file (`installed_packages.txt`)
- work with CRAN and all **remotes** supported package sources
- what about **drat**?

We should use the functionality from remotes::package_deps() and ## S3 method for class 'package_deps'
